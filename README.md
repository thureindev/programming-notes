# studying-with-AI
This repo is a personal project where I document my learning journey using AI. Disclaimer: While AI is super advanced, it’s not infallible. Always use your own logical thinking and brainstorming skills alongside AI’s help. It’s a tool to assist you, not a substitute for human judgment. Happy learning!
