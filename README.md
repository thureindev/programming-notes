# Welcome to my Study Tracking Repo!

Hey there! This repo is a personal project where I document my learning journey using AI. I’ve created a template to help you track your studies and conversations with AI, just like I do. It’s a great way to keep your questions and answers organized and make the most out of your AI interactions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While AI is super advanced, it’s not infallible.
> AI is a tool to assist you, not a substitute for human judgment.
> Always use your own logical thinking and brainstorming skills alongside AI’s help. 

***Happy learning!***

Open [guide.md](./guide.md#1-document-template) for usage instructions.
