### Common Naming Conventions

Each of these conventions has its own use cases depending on the context and the programming language.

***camelCase***
> Starts with a lowercase letter and uses uppercase letters to indicate the start of new words (e.g., thisIsCamelCase).

***PascalCase***
> Similar to camelCase but starts with an uppercase letter (e.g., ThisIsPascalCase).

***kebab-case***
> Uses lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words (e.g., this-is-kebab-case).

***snake_case***
> Uses lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (e.g., this_is_snake_case).

***SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE***
> Uses uppercase letters and underscores to separate words, often for constants (e.g., THIS_IS_SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE).

***Title Case***
> Capitalizes the first letter of each word, commonly used for titles (e.g., This Is Title Case).

***dot.notation***
> Uses dots to separate words, often seen in hierarchical data (e.g., this.is.dot.notation).
